# __When the inner clock fades: Interoceptive decline and consolidation of phase resettinginresting state cortical rhythms by cardiac events underlie healthy lifespan ageing__
This repository hosts code and pipelines developed at the Cognitive Brain Dynamics Lab (CBDL), National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) for studying age-related changes in heart-brain dynamics across age.

## __Background__
In this study, we demonstrate how cardiac rhythms can be used by neuronal systems as a clock to reset the ongoing brain
oscillations that are well-known to be a substrate of several aspects of human cognition and especially from this article’s
persepctive is the perception of time. Time-perception is a coninuous process which allows us to be self-aware of our
environment and body and has been shown to be disoriented in neurological disorders such as Parkinson and dementia.
Using heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs) in magnetoenecphalogram (MEG) data and advanced statistical analysis tools
from diverse fields such as signal processing and econometrics/ forecasting we examined heart–brain interactions in a large,
diverse cohort of healthy individuals (N = 620; age range: 18–88 years), and identified the prominent neural networks and
mechanisms involved in operationalization of the clock that accounts for the perception of time. We further shed light on
the normative lifespan trajectories of the heart-brain interactions both in terms of temporal coordination and spatial
organization.
